Steam link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026140530


Description

This script is designed for automatic and semi-automatic control of "Airplanes" - grids with wings (e.g. Plane Parts) and a single thrust vector (i.e. all thrusters facing the same direction). Simply put, for airplanes in the usual sense of the term.

The script features include:

  Autopilot – flight on the built route.
  
  Cruise control – maintain course, altitude and speed.
  
  Auto takeoff – from water, land, fire and wind or runway, by stored coordinates or ILS.
  
  Auto-landing – on water, land, or runway, by stored coordinates or ILS.
  
  Instrument landing system (ILS) – in this mode, the script broadcasts runway coordinates in real time (landing on aircraft carriers is possible).
  
  Waiting – customizable timer (in script), unique for each waypoint.
  
  Trigger timers on route points – unique timer name for each route point.
  
  Route generation – point to point / airplane to point, with altitude gain and descent gradient.
  
  Route operation – import/export, customize operation type, coordinates, speed, altitude, timer names, required ILS signals, wait time, etc.
  
  Landing gear control – landing gear timer trigger on takeoff and landing.
  
  Control of roll angles, pitch and yaw rates – strictly limit values in settings.
  
  Avionics control – thrusters, gyroscopes, air brakes, wheel brakes, compass heading.
  
  Light and sound warning system – playing signals according to actions.
  
  Information displays – Avionics, Navigation, TCAS prioritization and decisions, Status.
  
  Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System – TCAS.
  
  Ground Proximity Warning System – GPWS.
  

In style the system is similar to DAS – Driver Assisting System, but I tried to make my script more convenient and add as many features as possible. The script still needs a lot of polishing, customization and rewriting of some elements, so you can call it a beta version.

I've been coming to this result for a very long time and designed the system along with how I learned to program. It took me three years from idea to realization and I am not going to stop.
